<strong> How Do I Love Thee by Elizabeth Barrett Browning </strong>

<br/><br/>

<em><div> How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.</div>
<div> I love thee to the depth and breadth and height </div>
<div> My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight </div>
<div> For the ends of being and ideal grace. </div>
<div> I love thee to the level of every day’s </div>
<div> Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light.</div>
<div> I love thee freely, as men strive for right.</div>
<div> I love thee purely, as they turn from praise.</div>
<div> I love thee with the passion put to use </div>
<div> In my old griefs, and with my childhood’s faith.</div>
<div> I love thee with a love I seemed to lose </div>
<div> With my lost saints. I love thee with the breath, </div>
<div> Smiles, tears, of all my life; and, if God choose, </div>
    <div> I shall but love thee better after death.</div> </em>

<strong> Laughing Song by William Blake </strong>

<br/><br/>
<em><div> When the green woods laugh with the voice of joy, </div>
<div> And the dimpling stream runs laughing by; </div>
<div> When the air does laugh with our merry wit, </div>
    <div> And the green hill laughs with the noise of it; </div> 

<br/>
<div> When the meadows laugh with lively green, </div>
<div> And the grasshopper laughs in the merry scene; </div>
<div> When Mary and Susan and Emily </div>
    <div> With their sweet round mouths sing 'Ha ha he!' </div>

    
<br/>
<div> When the painted birds laugh in the shade, </div>
<div> Where our table with cherries and nuts is spread: </div>
<div> Come live, and be merry, and join with me, </div>
    <div> To sing the sweet chorus of 'Ha ha he!'</div> </em>

        

<br/><br/>
<strong> If by Rudyard Kipling </strong>
<br/><br/>
<em><div>If you can keep your head when all about you </div>   
    <div>Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,</div>  
    <div>If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,</div>
    <div>But make allowance for their doubting too; </div>  
    <div>If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,</div>
    <div>Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,</div>
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,
    <div>And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:</div>

    <br/>
    If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;<br>   
    If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;<br/>  
    If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster <br/>
    And treat those two impostors just the same;<br/>
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken<br/>
    Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br/>
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br/>
    And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:<br/>

    <br/>
If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br/>
    And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br/>
And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br/>
    And never breathe a word about your loss;<br/>
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew <br/>
    To serve your turn long after they are gone, <br/>  
And so hold on when there is nothing in you <br/>
    Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’<br/>

    <br/>
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,<br/> 
    Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,<br/>
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,<br/>
    If all men count with you, but none too much;<br/>
If you can fill the unforgiving minute <br/>
    With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,<br/>   
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,<br/>   
    And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!<br/></em>
